## wiim adapter for ioBroker

adapter to access Wiim/Arylic and other devices based on the Linkplay streaming/multiroom technology

## supported devices
The adapter has been tested with:

	Wiim Amp
 	Wiim Mini
  	Arylic up2stream v3
   	Arylic S10+
	Audiocast M5
	August WR320B (after firmware upgrade to 4.6.415156.0)
	August WS350K
	Audio Pro Addon C5A
	Müzo Cobblestone

Wiim devices use https communication, Arylic devices use http communication.
At least one feature (playPromptUrl) works only with Arylic devices with firmware >=4.6.415145 
Currently only the most important features of the API are implemented. Please let me know if other features are useful to you.

You can find information on the devices here:

WiiM: 		https://www.wiimhome.com/wiimvibelink/overview
Arylic:		https://www.arylic.com/
Audiocast:	https://audiocast.io/
			remark: Audicast M5 is sold under many different generic brands, I assume they all work with the adapter
August:		https://augustint.com/
			remark: the WR320B seems to be discontinued


## Adapter Configuration

	interval for refresh of player data in seconds: time between two requests for updated data


## States & Control Channels

The adapter automatically creates states for each detected WiiM, Arylic, or Linkplay-based streaming device. The states are divided into read-only metadata and read/write control states.

### Metadata & Status (Read-Only)
These states represent the current playback information and hardware metrics fetched from the device.

| State ID | Type | Role | Unit | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `artist` | string | `media.artist` | - | Name of the currently playing artist. |
| `album` | string | `media.album` | - | Name of the current album. |
| `title` | string | `media.title` | - | Title of the current track. |
| `albumArtURI` | string | `media.cover` | - | HTTP URL or URI pointing to the album cover artwork. |

| `loop_mode` | number | `value` | - | Raw numeric loop/repeat mode returned by the hardware. |
| `sampleRate` | number | `value` | Hz | Audio sample rate of the currently playing stream (e.g., 44100). |
| `bitDepth` | number | `value` | bit | Audio bit depth of the stream (e.g., 16 or 24 bit). |
| `lastRefresh` | string | `date` | - | Timestamp of the last successful data refresh from the device. |
